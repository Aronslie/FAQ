{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Setup" %}
## Website to get File

* Website \[1]: [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com) This website provides mods for many games including Genshin, there are many mods for you to find here. Create an account to be able to download 18+ mods

* Discord Server \[210]: [Anime Game Modding Group](https://discord.com/invite/AGMG) Where heroes make their own 18+ Mods

> NOTE: Mods will be mods for a certain item so please pay attention to a few things below. When downloading a mod file, it will be a zip file and you need to unzip it and copy the extracted folder to the "Mods" folder in step 2.

* Each character has one mod. If using a new mod for a character, delete or move the old mod of that character first.
* Only use 1 mod for the same character in the "Mods" folder. If there are 2 different mods for the same character in the "Mods" folder, it will cause an error.
* After choosing the skin you want to download and put it in the **`Mods`** folder

### Note (Always run 3Dmingo before turning on the tool)

* Run File: <mark style="color:blue;">**3DMigoto Loader.exe**</mark> and it will display the following CMD panel

* After entering the game, all mods placed in the "Mods" folder will be loaded.

> While you are in the game, if you change the mod in the "Mods" folder, press F10 in the game so the mod can be refreshed after the change.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Fix Error" %}
## **`Crash`**

* For some people, when running as instructed above, when running the tool when the game opens, it will crash and shut down immediately and cannot run at all. How to Fix the Above Situation:
* To change the method a bit, copy all the files including the folders in the "3dmigoto" folder into the game folder and put them with it.
* If you install the game by default, it will usually be in the following path: C:\Program Files\Genshin Impact\Genshin Impact game Copy it to the folder "Genshin Impact game" Now both the "Mods" folder and the "3DMigoto Loader.exe" file will be here. You will still add mods to the "Mods" folder here, but you will not need to use the "3DMigoto Loader" file. .exe" again.
* Now every time you run the tool, it will always run with 3dmigoto without needing to run anything else, and there will be no more crashes.
* However, if you don't want to run with 3dm anymore, you can do the following: In the game folder, rename the file "d3d11.dll" to make it different. If you want to run together, change the name to the same.
* Currently, an update of Genshin in 4.2 has caused you to get error 31-4302 when using the above crash fix method.

> \-> This is because michos file has detected a strange file in here so everyone put it back to where it was or you may not be able to play it.
>
> \-> After entering the tool and opening the menu, remember to turn on Bypass Integeti (specifically, I forgot)

Or you can look in the genshin folder for any different or strange files, delete that file

### Error Mod (This part I refer to from Takeshi) This error seems to start from version 4.2. When running, the mod model will fail.

> Download the fix model mod file on gamebanana: [HERE](https://gamebanana.com/tools/16084) The above file is for 4.4, every time you upgrade to a new version, look for the same file name for higher versions.
>
> Put the fix file into the "3dmigoto" folder as shown in the image and click to run the .exe file

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* It will fix the mods placed in the current "Mod" folder. If you add mods later, you have to run the fix file again.
* Now you need to go to Genshin, go to Settings > Image, Close(turn off) the "Character Movement Resolution" option, it's at the bottom.

#### That's it, now just need to F10 again to refresh the fixed mod.
